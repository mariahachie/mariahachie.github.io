<p>It's been a while since I've posted here. Last term, I worked at Autodesk Montreal and I gained a lot of valuable experience. The project was really interesting because it's one of the first of its kind, and even though a lot of progress has been made, I know that the team is going to accomplish even more.</p>

<p>I'm getting closer to graduating and I still feel like I have so much to learn in terms of school and work. This term I'm taking French (why not), computer networks, security & privacy, and software design and architecture. The classes seem pretty interesting so far. For my software design/architecture class, we get to make a mobile app. That should be fun, because it's my first time developing an Android app from scratch, and with other students.</p>

<p>That's all for now!</p>
