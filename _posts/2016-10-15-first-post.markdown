<p>Welcome to my blog! I've been meaning to start one for a while now, but I was always so intimidated by it. Thankfully there are a plethora of resources online, which makes it fairly simple nowadays. As for what I plan to post, it'll mostly be about my university and co-op experiences. Maybe the odd opinion post here and there.</p>

<p>Since I'm about halfway through my current work term at Toyota, I feel that this is a good time to reflect on things. Initially, I wasn't sure what to expect from this job. I was told that I'd need to use more soft skills than technical skills, and I figured that this would be a good opportunity for me to improve because I'm still quite shy. So far, I'm definitely using more soft skills for project development and planning compared to my previous jobs. I also have more technical responsibilities, which was a pleasant surprise for me. The project I'm assigned to at the moment is the largest one I've worked on independently. Not only that, but many of the managers are eager to use it because it'll make weekly processes easier. I don't want to disclose too many details, but I can say that I'm really enjoying my work thus far.</p>

<p>With regards to work culture, the dress code is pretty casual and everyone I've met is very friendly. I was invited to join the Business Intelligence team for their weekly "innovation sessions", where they use newer technologies to prototype efficient solutions to problems. I joined the machine learning group, where we're currently using Microsoft Azure, python, and some libraries to analyse tweets from Twitter and car repair orders. I'm really glad to have these opportunities, as I wouldn't have had the knowledge to learn about these things by myself.</p>

<p>As a co-op student at Toyota, I also have the chance to participate in corporate programs. For a few months each year, the employees in the Information Services department can sign out a new car for a day or two. This year, it's the 2016 Prius. Unfortunately I couldn't take it home because I'm living with my parents and we don't have enough space to park it :(
We also have a chance of seeing videos of new car unveilings months before the public, which is pretty cool.</p>
