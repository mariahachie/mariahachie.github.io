<p>I came back from my trip to Cuba only 4 days ago, and I miss the food and warm weather already. It's impossible to find lobster tails like this at a low cost in Toronto! Like all good things, my trip came to an end, so here I am in Waterloo braving the not so cold (yet) weather. Today marks the start of my 3rd year at the university, but I still feel like first year was not too long ago. I only had two lectures today, both CS, so it was fairly relaxed.</p>

<p>When I got home, I wrote out all my school related due dates on the agenda my supervisor at Toyota had given me. I'm really starting to appreciate having a hard copy, because it doesn't provide any opportunity for distraction compared to using an app on my phone or PC. Pictured at the top are my assignments and tests for the month of January.</p>

<p>A new school term also means another job search for many co-op students. I'm currently in the process of preparing my resume, and I'm curious to see what'll be posted in Waterloo Works. This is the first term they're allowing the main campus students to use it, so I hope it doesn't have any bugs!</p>
